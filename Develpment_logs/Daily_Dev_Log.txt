Summary
Today I created the base structure of the project and initialized the GitHub repository. I also implemented the first three core components of the digital twin as Python classes: Battery, CloudCoverage, and SolarPanel.

Work completed
1) Project setup
- Created the initial folder structure (src/, tests/, results/, Development_logs/, Personal_reflections/).
- Initialized the GitHub repository and pushed the base scaffold.

2) Core classes implemented (src/)
- Battery.py: battery model with capacity (kWh), minimum SoC constraint, and round-trip efficiency handling.
- CloudCoverage.py: seasonal cloud coverage generator using weighted probabilities and coverage ranges.
- SolarPanel.py: solar generation model based on time-of-day and cloud coverage reduction.

3) Testing and verification (tests/)
- I used AI assistance to generate initial test files to validate that my implementation behaved correctly (basic sanity checks for charge/discharge behavior, seasonal cloud distributions, and solar generation across different hours).
- During testing, I noticed the solar generation function was producing weird/unrealistic values. The AI helped me identify why the formula/mapping was wrong and guided me to correct the time-to-angle setup so the curve behaves as expected (zero at night, peak around midday) and then apply cloud coverage as a proportional reduction.
- This was very helpful because it confirmed my code was working and clarified the reason behind the incorrect results I was seeing.

Notes / Issues
- Main issue today was the incorrect solar generation behavior due to the initial formula setup. After fixing the mapping and re-running tests, results became consistent with expectations.

Next steps
- Implement Inverter class with clipping and failure simulation
- Implement Load class with base + random spikes
- Implement Grid class with import/export tracking
